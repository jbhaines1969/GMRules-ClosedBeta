# GMRules Closed Beta Agent Handoff

Updated: 2026-07-02
Repo root: `C:\Users\John\IdeaProjects\GMRules-ClosedBeta`

This is the start-here snapshot for recovering the project after context loss or a machine failure.

## Startup Checklist

Read these files first:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `PROJECT_NOTES.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `USER.md` if it exists locally. It is ignored by Git and contains user-specific collaboration preferences.

Then inspect `git status --short` before editing so new docs and user changes are not overwritten.

## Current Repo State

This repo is the current closed-beta deploy release for GMRules.

- Maven parent includes `gmrules-core` and `gmrules-builder`.
- `gmrules-core` contains the canonical ruleset model and `.gmrf` persistence.
- `gmrules-builder` contains the legacy Swing builder plus the web server, web API, and SPA assets.
- Web entry point is `com.gamemaker.gmrules.web.WebMain`.
- `node --check gmrules-builder/src/main/resources/web/app.js`, `mvn test`, and `mvn package` passed locally on 2026-07-02 after the feedback-intake implementation pass.
- `mvn test` passed again on 2026-07-02 after deleting the feedback-specific TODO file and fixing `EmailService` Closed Beta copy.
- There are currently no automated test sources, so successful Maven runs are compile/build verification, not behavioral coverage.
- New continuity docs were added at the repo root: `PROJECT_NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

## Active Resume Point

Feedback intake implementation is complete and smoke-tested. The next session should resume from this state, not restart the feedback work.

Implemented so far:

- Added a topbar Report action and report modal in the web app.
- Report types are `feedback`, `bug`, and `blocker`.
- The client captures safe metadata only: current route, app mode/page, builder stage, draft id reference, browser user agent, and client timestamp.
- Added `POST /api/feedback`.
- The server requires a logged-in session, validates size and required fields, rate-limits submissions, writes a local JSONL copy first, then attempts Discord delivery.
- Added `FeedbackStore` for local private report storage under `GMRULES_WEB_FEEDBACKDIR`.
- Added `DiscordWebhookService`; it is inert when webhook URLs are blank and logs failures without printing webhook URLs.
- Added config keys for `GMRULES_WEB_FEEDBACKDIR`, `GMRULES_DISCORD_FEEDBACKWEBHOOKURL`, `GMRULES_DISCORD_BUGWEBHOOKURL`, and `GMRULES_DISCORD_BLOCKERWEBHOOKURL`.
- Fixed the visible save-status separator in `app.js`.
- Hosted smoke testing passed: one feedback report, one bug report, and one blocker report reached the expected Discord channels and wrote expected JSONL files on the Droplet.
- The feedback-specific TODO file was deleted after its remaining unchecked future items were moved into `TODO.md`.
- `EmailService` now uses "GMRules Closed Beta" copy and neutral unrequested-access text.
- Hosted account/draft smoke passed: account deletion/recreation, email verification, password creation, login, new draft creation, draft deletion, `.gmrf` export/download, `.gmrf` upload/import, opening uploaded content, and saved-draft limit counting worked.
- Signup/application rate limiting was added: two applications per IP per day, one per email per day, no resend over an active pending verification email, plus the existing ten-account cap.
- The beta application page now states the 10 accepted tester cap and two applications per connection per day.
- `.gmrf` import/export rate limiting was added: two import attempts and two download attempts per account per rolling seven days.

External setup completed:

- The user created private Discord channels `feedback`, `bugs`, and `blockers`, created one webhook per channel, and added the expected webhook variables to production `.env`.
- The user verified only variable names with a safe masked/name-only command; webhook values were not pasted into chat.
- Do not ask the user to reconstruct missing crash-era personal notes while impaired. The repo-relevant resume state is captured here; defer any non-repo personal/user notes until the user is sober and explicitly wants to rebuild them.

Next repo steps:

- Review and commit any remaining feedback-intake/doc updates only if the user explicitly asks.
- Beta launch blockers in `TODO.md` are checked off. Next work should move to the high-priority-after-first-invites section unless the user redirects.

## Product Status

Proof-of-concept functionality is present:

- Closed-beta NDA application page.
- Resend email verification path.
- Password creation and login.
- File-backed account storage.
- Server-backed `.gmrf` draft creation/import/open/delete/export.
- In-app feedback, bug report, and blocker/crash report intake with local storage and Discord forwarding.
- Builder stages through setup, measurements, dice, attribute generation, attributes, hit points, armor class, currency, effects/statuses, equipment, weapons, skills, spells, races, and classes.
- Early web character-generation flow through attributes, race, and class.

User-provided deployment context:

- The app is hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet.
- In the Digital Ocean web console, the user is already logged in as `root`; avoid `sudo` in console commands unless the user says they are using a non-root shell.
- The user has a domain and can go live with a redirect.
- Resend email is tested and working.
- Two people have successfully received acceptance emails and created accounts.
- Discord is intended as the feedback receiver with three stages/intake types.

## Current Gaps

Launch blockers are tracked in `TODO.md`. Most important:

- Final domain is confirmed in production `.env`: `GMRULES_WEB_PUBLICBASEURL=https://gmrules.com`.
- `deploy.sh` is confirmed correct for the current Digital Ocean server-side launcher flow.
- Production env vars are now documented in `.env.example`; manual backup/restore for `server-data/`, `drafts/`, and `.env` has been implemented and tested.
- Beta launch blockers are complete. Next: rate limits for login and password setup endpoints.

## Build Notes

From the repo root:

```powershell
mvn test
mvn package
```

Expected package output:

```text
target/gmrules-app.jar
```

The droplet data directories are runtime state, not source:

```text
server-data/
drafts/
.env
server-data/feedback/
```

Back them up before widening the beta.

Manual encrypted backup script:

```bash
cd /opt/gmrules
./makebackup.sh
```

It writes `/tmp/gmrules-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz.gpg` and removes the unencrypted `.tar.gz`.

Manual restore script:

```bash
cd /opt/gmrules
./restore.sh
```

It auto-selects the single `/tmp/gmrules-backup-*.tar.gz.gpg` file when only one exists. It decrypts to a temporary folder, validates `server-data/`, `drafts/`, and `.env`, creates a pre-restore safety backup, asks for `RESTORE`, stops the service, restores runtime data, and starts the service. If multiple matching backups exist in `/tmp`, pass the exact backup path.

## Next Best Moves

1. Add smoke coverage/checklists around account verification, login, and draft persistence/export.
2. Fix remaining small visible UI issues.
3. Launch a small controlled beta cohort and monitor Discord/server logs.
